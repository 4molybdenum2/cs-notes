Model -> is a process of understanding a system through imitation. It defines what a system does
Design -> is the structured creation of artifacts. defines how a system does it.
Analysis -> process of understanding a system through dissecton. defines why a system does what.



Modeling techiques:
1. modeling physical phenomal
2. feedback control systems (time domain modeling)
3. Modeling modal behaviour (FSMs, hybrid automata)
4. modeling sensors and actuators
5. modeling hardware and software
6. modeling networks


Feedback Control System:
Balance out a uncontrolled differential equation to a specified state

Plant -> State -> controller -> control input -> Plant


**Actor Model of Systems**
A system is a function which accepts an input signal and yields an output signal.

The domain and range of system functions are sets of signals which themselves are functions



**Proportional Controller**
