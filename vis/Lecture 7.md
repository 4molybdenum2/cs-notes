Gestalt Principle:
The tendency to perceive elements belonging to a group, based on certain visual properties (top-down attention)
- concept of totality


Saliency Map:
pay attention to interesting details first, then integrate into a scene (bottom up attention)


Pre-attentiveness:
certain low level aspects are recognized first, before conscious awareness


Visual variables:
different visual aspects can be used to encode information

planar vars:
1. spatial dimensions
2. map (arm, grip) to (x,y)

retinal variables:
1. size
2. color
3. shape
4. orientation
5. texture
6. brightness

Associative (lowest organizational level, enables visual grouping) v/s Selective (next lowest organizational level, enables viewer to isolate encoded data and ignore other):
Both are nominal qualities

Takeaways:

Planar variable is the single most strongest visual variable
1. maps to proximity
2. provides an intuitive organization of information
3. things close together are perceptually grouped together

Size and brightness are good secondary visual variables to encode relative magnitude
1. size appeals to spatial perceptive channels

What are the advantages and disadvantages of brightness
+ brightness does not consume extra space (bigger disks do)
- brightness depends on environmental lighting (size does not)
where do you view the visualization (office, outdoors, night or day?)


Color is good for labeling

Shape provides only limited pop-out

Brightness is for fine detail contrast


Opponent Color:
1. Black - white
2. Red - green
3. Blue - Yellow

Color blindness - red and green


Deuteranopia - green missing
Protanopia - red missing
Tritanopia - blue missing



What to do for color blindness?
- place red and green apart
- different intensities for red and green
- add symbols to line charts or vary line style
- avoid using gradient colors to indicate data-value



Strong colors - small areas
Subtle colors - large areas
Few colors for color coding
Luminance for detail, shape and form



Why not using Rainbow color map?
Color scale is not matched with out perception. Instead use color map with perceptual ordering
Rainbow color maps can be used if intervals are chosen carefully


Moreland's diverging color map:


Brewer scales:


Nominal scales: distinct hues
Sequential scales: vary in lightness and saturation, vary slightly in hue
Diverging scale: complementary sequential scales, neutral at "zero"
