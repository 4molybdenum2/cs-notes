Edward Tufte's views

1. **popularized concept on small multiples:**
	1. many data vis elements are broken down into simpler elements
	2. for example, suppose a metric is broken down across various states and show separately rather than a single chart
2. **sparklines:**
	1. charts or graphs tightly integrated into text or even code

**visual embellishments -> chart junk**
**abuse of physically motivated distortions -> lie factor**

**lie factor = graphical factor / real factor**

- avoid suggestive distortions
- show data in proper context
- avoid display of out of context data


Principles that determine graphical integrity:
1. representation of numbers must be directly proportional to the numbers
2. clear and detailed labeling
3. show data variations not design variations
4. in time series display of money show standardized units
5. number of info carrying dimensions must not exceed dataset dimensions
6. dont quote out of context data
7. convincing graphics must demonstrate cause and effect


but what about engagement?
- if used properly pictograms do not inferere with understanding of vis
- vis that are memorable at glance are also capable of transmission of right messages
- redundancy helps effectively communicate the message


Important for memorability:
1. color
2. inclusion of human recognisable object


Graphical visualizations for more engagement



Graphical excellence is what gives the user:
1. greatest no of ideas
2. in smallest space
3. in shortest time
4. with the least amount of ink
