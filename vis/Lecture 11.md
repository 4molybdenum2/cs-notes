Visual Analytics and the visual sense making process:

**Problems with scalability:**
**must be Scalable to:**
1. number of data points
2. number of dimensions
3. number of users / diversity of users
4. number of tasks


**Change Blindness**
Visual analytics:
1. helps humans deal with change blindness
2. help humans cope with insufficient memory
3. helps externalize memory


**Magic number 7:**
1. +-2 things humans can keep in mem at a time.
2. channel cap 2.5 bits
3. not more than 7 segments in a pie chart
4. not more than 7 colors in a line chart


**Strategies for dealing with complexity:**
1. decomposition of a complex problem into simpler problems
2. externalize into computer or paper
3. show relationships between data
4. decision making is difficult - write down pros and cons


**The Sense making loop:**
Gather info -> Re-represent -> develop insight -> produce results
