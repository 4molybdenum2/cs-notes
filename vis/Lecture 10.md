Information navigation

1. how can we deal with info overload?
2. allow users to control (extent of data, level of detail, aspects of data)
3. provide navigation hints
	1. sort
	2. rescale
	3. reexpress
	4. filtering
	5. zooming
	6. aggregate (Biplots, MDS, PCP)
	7. info space overview + detail
	8. fisheye lens (keeps target item in focus, but causes distortion)
	9. perspective wall
	10. magic lens (shows details using panning on an area)
	11. zoom and pan -> transfer of focus (zoom out -> pan -> zoom in)
	12. semantic zoom -> shows a different representation depending on available space -> like google maps !
		1. can switch datasets to the one with higher res
		2. synthesize detail on each level of zoom
		3. constrained synthesis
	13. exploded views
	14. brushing and linking
		1. atleast two things must be linked for this to work -> for example two views


Important rules for dashboard:
1. most important views goes on the top or top left
2. 5 views or less
3. interactivity
4. avoid multiple color schemes
