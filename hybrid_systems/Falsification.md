Hybrid System -> Simulation (with start state and input signal) -> STL monitoring -> ok / not ok



**Signal Temporal Logic**:
1. Connect LTL with temporal semantics
2. Model checking, monitoring (computing properties for finite set of states for an execution path)
3. LTL->STL (Extension of LTL with real-time real-valued constraints)
4. Quantitative satisfaction of STL can accommodate noise/approximations and more


**Robust Monitoring of STL**:
A robust STL monitor is a transducer than transforms x into p_phi_(x)
