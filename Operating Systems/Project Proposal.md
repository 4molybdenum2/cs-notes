Really original ideas:
1. writing our own implementation of heap allocators (https://os.phil-opp.com/ check section on heap allocation....but still a lot of things will have to implemented alongside that)
2. 

From last year project slides:
1. CFS scheduler performance evaluation is a good idea - we can simulate other schedulers as well and create a comparison chart.
2. Measuring syscall costs for FlexSC is also a good idea - but we will need to search for other syscall projects
3. superpage is a viable idea
4.
