the result of any execution is the same as if the operations of all the processors were executed in some sequential order, and the operations of each individual processor appear in this sequence in the order specified by its program.


Example 1:

W(X)  = 1
			     R(X) = 0            R(X) = 1




Example 2:

W(X) = 1
				 R(X) = 1             R(X) = 1
