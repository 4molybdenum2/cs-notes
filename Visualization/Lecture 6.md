color - cones
grey - rods


Retina can handle a high range of intensity but it cannot handle all simultaneously.
 - each region in eye adapts to a small intensity range determined by the local intensity.
 - bright area saturates intensity.


Herman Grid illusion
- at the intersection more inhibitory ganglion cells, therefore that seems gray
- it disappears as soon as we look because central vision is sharp

Dynamic Range Contrast:
- local adaptation level varies, which changes relative contrast of objects in local scene

Guidelines:
- use saturated colors sparingly - can cause undesired effect
- neutral borders can help



Visible range 400nm to 700nm
human eye differentiates about 300 hues and 100-150 luminance variations
orange is a dominant wavelength



Perceptual Color Spaces
Can you generate all visible colors with three primaries? - No


CIE Color spaces - quantitative links between visually perceived colors and wavelengths. Mathematical relationships that define these color spaces are tools for color management.


In colorimetry, the Munsell color system isÂ **a color space that specifies colors based on three properties of color: hue (basic color), chroma (color intensity), and value (lightness)**.


Non perceptual color spaces:

How to convert RGB to HSV?




Contrast:
Difference of brightness in adjacent regions of an image
- gray level luminance
- color contrast

Contrast needs brightness diff


Chromatic abberation:
- Different wavelengths of light are focused at different distances in eye
- human eye has no correctness for chromatic abberation
- short wavelength blue is refracted more than red,
- focusing on red will tend to ignore blue more


Pre-attentive processing:
- 50% of brain is dedicated to vision

Organization of Human Brain:
LGN: left lateral geniculate nucleus of thalamus
V1: primary visual cortex - quarter sized area in the back of the head (first cortical stage for visual processing)
Higher level areas dedicated to spatial reasoning, associative object recognition
